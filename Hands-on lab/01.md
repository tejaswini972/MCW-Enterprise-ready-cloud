## Exercise 1: Create the policy for Enterprise IT

Duration: 60 minutes

In this exercise, you will first create a Management Group for your Azure subscription(s). You will apply several of the built-in Azure Policy definitions to that Management Group to ensure that users stay within the scope of supported services for Enterprise IT. Finally, you will create a new policy initiative defining a multi-resource naming convention and apply that initiative to the Management Group.

### Task 1: Create a Management Group

In this task, you will create a new Management Group and move a subscription into this Management Group. We'll later assign Azure Policy using the Management Group scope, so that it applies automatically to all subscriptions under that scope.

> **Note**: We'll use our own Management Group, if you have permissions you could also use the Tenant Root Management Group.

1. From the Azure portal click the menu icon on the left top corner and select **All services**.

    ![Portal screenshot showing All Service \> Management Groups selection sequence.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image4.png "Create Management Group selection path")

2. Then select **Start using management groups** to launch the **Add management group** blade.

    ![Azure portal screenshot, showing the location of the show portal menu icon.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image89.png "Expand the blade")

    If you already have management groups in place, you can use the **Add management group** button to launch the **Add management group** blade.

    ![Azure portal screenshot, showing the Add management group button that is used to launch the Add management group blade.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image91.png "Add management group button")

3. In the **Add management group** blade enter **ERC** for the Management group ID and **Enterprise Ready Cloud** for the Management group display name. Select **Save**. If you have existing management groups, create this as a child of Root and select **Save**. Note that the Management group ID cannot be updated after creation but your display name can be updated later.

    > **Note**: If this is the first management group being created, it may take up to 15 minutes for it to complete.

    ![Azure portal screenshot showing the notification that it may take up to 15 minutes to create the management group.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image90.png "Create management group notification")

4. Select the newly created management group, then select **details**.

    ![Azure portal screenshot showing the details link for the newly created management group.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image92.png "Details link")

5. Select **Add Subscription** and for the subscription, choose your subscription from the drop-down list, then select **Save**.

### Task 2: Apply the service catalog policy

In this exercise, you will apply one of the built-in Azure Policies to restrict services to the supported list provided by Trey Research.

1. First, we need to build a list of resource types, which will be permitted, and their corresponding resource providers. One way to do this is to use PowerShell. Launch the **Azure Cloud Shell** and select PowerShell. If prompted to create storage, select the **Create storage** button. Accept the prompt for storage.

    ![Azure portal screenshot showing the button to launch the Azure Cloud Shell.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image93.png "Azure Cloud Shell launch button")

    ![Azure portal screenshot showing the Azure Cloud Shell first launch experience.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image94.png "Azure Cloud Shell PowerShell")

2. Run the following script in the shell:

    ```powershell
    $FormatEnumerationLimit = -1
    Get-AzResourceProvider `
        | Select-Object ProviderNamespace, ResourceTypes `
        | Format-List
    ```

3. Review the list, and identify the resource providers and resource types for each of the following:

    ```s
    Resource Name
    --------------------------
    - Resource Group
    - Virtual Machines
    - Disk
    - Network Interface
    - Public IP Address
    - Network Security Group
    - Virtual Networks
    - Virtual Network Gateways
    - ExpressRoute Circuits
    - VPN Gateways
    - Storage Accounts
    - Backup Vault
    - Site Recovery Vault
    - DevTest Labs
    - Key Vault
    - Web Apps
    - SQL Database
    ```

    For example, to find all the resource providers with resource groups as a resource type, a query like the following could be used:

    ```powershell
    Get-AzResourceProvider `
        | Select-Object ProviderNamespace, ResourceTypes `
        | Where-Object { $_.ResourceTypes.ResourceTypeName -like "*resource*groups*" } `
        | Format-List
    ```

    This query shows that the `resourceGroups` resource type is a member of the resource provider `Microsoft.Resources`.

    By altering the `-like` clause, you can filter to easily find the resource providers for the remaining resource types.

    > **Note**: If you do not see the Microsoft.Compute resource provider it is because you have not yet created any compute resources. You can manually register the provider with the following command:

    ```powershell
    Register-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.Compute
    ```

4. In the Azure portal, navigate to **Policy** under **All services**:

    ![Azure portal screenshot, showing selection sequence All Services, then Policy.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image7.png "Azure Policy selection path ")

    > **Hint**: Select the star next to the Policy service to pin it to your Portal navigation. You will visit the Policy service throughout the lab.

5. Select **Definitions**, then **+ Policy definition**.

    ![Azure portal screenshot, showing selection sequence Definitions, then add Policy definition.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image101.png "Add Policy definition")

6. In the Policy definition blade, use the following configurations:

    - Definition location: **Enterprise Ready Cloud** (ERC) management group, as created in Task 1.
  
    - Name: **Service catalog**
  
    - Description: **Restrict resource types to those permitted by Enterprise IT**.
  
    - Category: **Create new** > **Service catalog**
  
    - Policy rule: ***Replace the default JSON with the following code:***

    ```json
    {
        "policyRule": {
            "if": {
                "not": {

                "effect" : "deny"
            }
        }
    }
    ```

7. Select **Save**.

8. On the ***Policy \- Definitions*** blade, select the **Service catalog** policy definition you just created and then select **Assign** on the *Service catalog* blade.

    ![Azure portal screenshot showing the service catalog policy definition.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image102.png "Service catalog policy definition")

    > **Note**: If you do not see the policy, make sure "Enterprise Ready Cloud" is the selected scope, and not another Management group or an individual subscription.

9. On the ***Service catalog \- Assign policy blade***, specify the following configurations and then select **Assign** to assign your policy definition to your Enterprise Ready Cloud management group:

    - Scope: **ERC**
  
    - Exclusions: **None**
  
    - Policy definition: **Service catalog**
  
    - Assignment name: **Service catalog policy**
  
    - Description: **Restrict resource types to those permitted by Enterprise IT**.
  
    - Policy enforcement: **Enabled**
  
    - Assigned by: **Enterprise IT**

    The assignment form should look like this:

    ![Azure portal screenshot, showing the Assign Policy blade. The Allowed resource types policy has been chosen, and 12 resource types selected.](images/erc01.png "Assign Policy blade")

10. Select **Review + Create**. Then select the **Create** button to complete the configuration.

### Task 3: Restrict the creation of ExpressRoute circuits

In this exercise, you will apply another built-in Azure policy to restrict the creation of ExpressRoute circuits. For this policy, we'll use an exclusion scope for the resource group in which Enterprise IT will create the permitted ExpressRoute circuits.

1. First, we'll create the resource group for the exclusion scope. Return to **Home** and select **Resource groups**, then **Add**, and then enter the resource group name **ExpressRouteRG**, select your subscription, and choose a resource group location:

    ![Azure portal screenshot, showing adding a resource group called \'ExpressRoute-group\'.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image104.png "Create resource group selection path")

2. Once complete, select **Review + Create** and then **Create**.

3. Return to the **Policy** blade in the Azure portal. Select **Assignments**, then **Assign Policy**. Complete the form as follows:

    - Scope: **Enterprise Ready Cloud** (The management group created earlier.)
  
    - Exclusions: **The resource group created in Step 1 above, ExpressRouteRG. Select the management group, subscription, and resource group**.
  
    - Policy definition: **Not allowed resource types**
  
    - Assignment name: **Block ExpressRoute circuits**
  
    - Description: **Block creating of ExpressRoute circuits, except in the Enterprise IT dedicated ExpressRoute resource group**
  
    - Policy enforcement: **Enabled**
  
    - Assigned by: **Enterprise IT**

    The assignment form should look like this:

    ![Azure portal screenshot, showing the Assign Policy blade. The policy is \'Not allowed resource types\' and the ExpressRouteCircuits resource type has been selected. The policy is assigned at the Management group scope, with the ExpressRouteGroup resource group as an exclusion path.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image163.png "Assign Policy blade")

4. When complete, select **Next** to set the Parameters in the policy assignment.

5. From the drop-down list select the option **expressRouteCircuits**.

6. Select **Review + create**. Your Assign policy screen should look like the below screen shot. Once confirmed select **Create**.

    ![Azure portal screenshot, showing the Assign Policy blade. The policy is \'Not allowed resource types\' and the ExpressRouteCircuits resource type has been selected. The policy is assigned at the Management group scope, with the ExpressRouteGroup resource group as an exclusion path.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image164.png "Assign Policy blade")

### Task 4: Restrict the creation of resources in regions

In this exercise, you will create a new Azure Policy assignment that restricts the regions in which resources can be created in.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to **Policy**, then select **Assignments**, then **Assign Policy**. Complete the form as follows:

    - Scope: **Enterprise Ready Cloud**
  
    - Exclusions: **None**
  
    - Policy definition: **Allowed locations**
  
    - Assignment name: **Restrict Azure locations**
  
    - Description: **Restrict Azure resources to the list of Azure regions permitted by Enterprise IT**
  
    - Policy enforcement: **Enabled**
  
    - Assigned by: **Enterprise IT**

    The assignment form should look like this:

    ![Azure portal screenshot, showing the Assign Policy blade. The \'Allowed locations\' policy has been selected, with 6 locations selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image165.png "Assign Policy blade")

2. When complete, select **Next** to set the Parameters on the policy assignment.

3. Within the Allowed Locations drop-down menu, select the following options:

    - Allowed locations: **East US, West US, North Europe, West Europe, Japan East, Japan West**

4. When complete, select **Review + Create** to review the Assign Policy for the locations and allowed resources. Your results should look like the below screen shot.

    ![Azure portal screenshot, showing the Assign Policy blade. The \'Allowed locations\' policy has been selected, with 6 locations selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image166.png "Assign Policy blade")

5. Select **Create** to complete the assign policy wizard.

### Task 5: Create and apply a naming convention

In this task, we will define a simple naming convention for Azure resources. We shall simply require that virtual machine names end with ***-vm*** and virtual networks end with ***-vnet***. We will implement this naming convention using a custom policy definition and a policy initiative, assigned at the management group scope.

#### Subtask 1: Create a policy definition <!-- omit in toc -->

First, we will create a generic policy definition that restricts resources of a given type to have a given name suffix. The resource type and name suffix will be specified using parameters.

1. In the Azure portal, open the **Policy** blade, then select **Definitions** and then **+ Policy definition**.

    ![Azure portal screenshot, showing the selection sequence Policy then Definitions then Add Policy Definition.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image106.png "Add policy definition selection path")

2. Complete the Policy definition form as follows:

    - Definition location: **Enterprise Ready Cloud** (The Management Group created earlier.)
  
    - Name: **Restrict Resource Name Suffix**
  
    - Description: **Restrict resources of a given type to have a name ending with a given suffix. The resource type and suffix are parameterized.**
  
    - Category:  **Create new** > **Naming**
  
    - Policy rule: **Replace with the below JSON**:

    ```json
    {
        "properties": {
            "mode": "all",
            "parameters": {
                "resourceType": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "metadata": {
                        "displayName": "Resource Type",
                        "description": "The resource type for this policy",
                        "strongType": "resourceTypes"
                    }
                },
                "nameSuffix": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "metadata": {
                        "displayName": "Resource Name Suffix",
                        "description": "The suffix that must be appended"
                    }
                }
            },
            "policyRule": {
                "if": {
                    "allof": [
                    {
                        "field": "type",
                        "equals": "[parameters('resourceType')]"
                    },
                    {
                        "not": {
                        "field": "name",
                        "like": "[concat('*-', parameters('nameSuffix'))]"
                        }
                    }
                    ]
                },
                "then": {
                    "effect": "deny"
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

3. Once the policy definition is complete, select **Save**.

#### Subtask 2: Create a policy initiative <!-- omit in toc -->

Next, we shall create a policy initiative comprising multiple instances of our policy definition (one per resource type).

1. From the **Policy** blade, on the **Definitions** panel, select **+ Initiative Definition**.

2. Fill in the **Initiative definition** blade as follows (but **do not** select **Save** yet).

    - Definition location: **Enterprise Ready Cloud** (The Management Group created earlier.)
  
    - Name: **Naming Convention**
  
    - Description: **Trey Research resource naming convention**
  
    - Category: **Use Existing** > **Naming**

    ![Azure portal screenshot showing the \'Basics\' section of the New Policy Initiative Definition blade. The Name has been filled in as \'Naming Convention\'.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image167.png "New Policy Definition - Basics")

3. Under ***Available Definitions***, find the *Restrict Resource Name Suffix* policy definition created in Step 2.

    ![Azure portal screenshot showing the \'Available Definitions\' section of the New Policy Initiative Definition blade. The filter has been filled in as \'restrict\' and the results show the \'Restrict Resource Name Suffix\' policy definition](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image14.png "Available Definitions screenshot")

4. Select the policy definition, then select **+Add** to add the Policy Definition to the Policy Initiative.

    ![Azure portal screenshot, showing adding the \'restrict resource name suffix\' custom policy definition to a policy initiative](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image15.png "Adding Policy Definition to Policy Initiative")

5. Select the resource type and name suffix. In this case, we'll choose **Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines** as the resource type and **vm** as the name suffix. **Do not select Save**.

    ![Azure portal screenshot, showing filling in the parameters for the \'Restrict Resource Name Suffix\' policy definition, as part of the policy initiative definition](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image16.png "Policies and Parameters screenshot")

6. Repeat steps 3-5 above except enter the following values:

      - Resource Type: **Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks**

      - Resource Name Suffix: **vnet**

    ![Azure portal screenshot, showing filling in the parameters for the \'Restrict Resource Name Suffix\' policy definition, as part of the policy initiative definition.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image168.png "Policies and Parameters screenshot")

7. Once you've added each resource type, select **Save**.

8. Finally, we will apply the policy initiative across all subscriptions in the Management Group by creating an assignment at the Management group scope. On the **Policy** blade, select **Assignments** and then **Assign Initiative**.

    ![Azure portal screenshot, showing the selection sequence Policy then Assignments then Assign Initiative.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image108.png "Assign Initiative selection path")

9.  Complete the Assign Initiative form as follows:

    - Scope: **Enterprise Ready Cloud** (The Management Group created earlier.)
  
    - Exclusions: **None**

    - Initiative definition: **Naming Convention** (The initiative definition we just created.)
  
    - Assignment name: **Resource Naming Convention**
  
    - Description: **Enforces company-wide resource naming convention**
  
    - Policy enforcement: **Enabled**
  
    - Assigned by: **Enterprise IT**

    The assignment form should look like this:

    ![Azure portal screenshot, showing the Assign Initiative blade. The Naming Convention policy initiative has been selected, and the assignment is at the management group scope.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image169.png "Assign Initiative Azure portal blade")

10. When complete, select **Review + Create**, then select **Create** to create the policy initiative assignment.

### Task 6: Test the policies

In this task, you will use the Azure management portal to validate each of the policies created so far and understand how to identify policy events.

#### Subtask 1: Test the service catalog policy <!-- omit in toc -->

1. In the portal's left navigation select **Create a Resource \> Internet of Things \> IoT Hub**.

    ![Azure portal screenshot, showing selection sequence to create an IoT Hub resource](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image19.png "Create IoT hub Azure portal selection path")

2. Specify a unique name for the IoT Hub and choose the existing **ExpressRouteRG** resource group. Choose a permitted location (we are only testing the Service Catalog policy at this time).

    Once all the settings have been filled in, select **Review + create** followed by **Create**.

    ![Azure portal screenshot showing the review and create experience for an IoT Hub.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image95.png "Azure IoT Hub Create")

3. The IoT Hub creation blade should show an error. If you select the error message you will see in the activity log that there were policy errors. 

    ![Azure portal screenshot, showing error message](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image21.png "Error screenshot")

#### Subtask 2: Test the ExpressRoute circuit policy <!-- omit in toc -->

1. In the portal's left navigation, select **Create a resource** **\>** **Networking** **\>** **ExpressRoute**.

    ![Azure portal screenshot, showing the selection sequence to create an ExpressRoute circuit](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image23.png "Create ExpressRoute selection path")

2. Specify the following configuration for the circuit and select **Create**.

    - Create new or import from classic: **Create new**
  
    - Circuit name: **TestCircuit**
  
    - Provider: **AT&T**
  
    - Peering location: **Silicon Valley**
  
    - Bandwidth: **50Mbps**
  
    - SKU: **Standard**
  
    - Billing model: **Unlimited**
  
    - Subscription: **Select your Azure subscription**.
  
    - Resource group: (Create new) **PolicyTestRG**.
   
    - Location: **Any available location in the allowed locations policy including East US, West US, North Europe, West Europe, Japan East, Japan West**.

    ![The Circuit configuration fields are set to the following settings: Circuit name, TestCircuit; Provider, AT&T; Peering location, Silicon Valley; Bandwidth, 50Mbps; SKU, Standard; Billing model, Unlimited; Subscription, Microsoft Azure; Resource Group, PolicyTestRG, Location, West US.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image24.png "Circuit configuration fields")

3. As with the Service Catalog policy, you should see an error in the Create ExpressRoute Circuit blade, which when selected shows the error details:

    ![Azure portal screenshot, showing error message \"The template deployment failed because of policy violation\".](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image96.png "Validation Error screenshot")


    > **Note**: If you created a new resource group in the previous step, you will see that the resource group has been created even though the deployment of the resource failed. This is because the policy that was created to restrict the creation of ExpressRoute circuits specifically targets that Azure resource type and a resource group is another distinct resource type.

#### Subtask 3: Test the resource location policy <!-- omit in toc -->

1. Testing the resource location policy follows a similar pattern. You would attempt to create a permitted resource, with a permitted name, but in a non-permitted region. For example, you can attempt to create a virtual network within the **PolicyTestRG** resource group named **erc-vnet** in **South Central US**. This should be rejected by the **Restrict Azure locations** policy.

    ![Azure portal screenshot, showing Errors blade. The error message states the template deployment failed due to a policy violation.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-readycloudimages/media/image110.png "Policy Violation error message")

2. To test further, change the region to a permitted location (e.g. **East US**) and try again. This time, the virtual network should be created without issue.

    > **Note**: Recall that an initiative assignment was made earlier to deny the creation of resources that do not meet the organizational naming conventions. If you had attempted to create a virtual networking without `-vnet` in its name, the creation of the resource would have been denied by the initiative assignment and its associated configuration.

#### Subtask 4: Test the naming convention policy <!-- omit in toc -->

1. Attempt to create a permitted resource, in a permitted location, with a non-permitted name. For example, create a virtual network within the **PolicyTestRG** resource group named **erc-network** in the **East US** region. This should be rejected by the **Resource Naming Convention** policy.

2. To test further, change to a permitted name (e.g. **erc-network-vnet**) and try again---this time, the virtual network should be created without issue.
